** Note: This package is still under construction. More functions will be added later.**

## `mytools` is a collection of my own functions.

### Installation
```{r installation, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("YijunXie/mytools")
library(mytools)
```

### Quick demo
- Calculate coefficient of tail independence
```{r}
chi.bar(rnorm(1000),q = 0.95, n = 1, conf = 0.95)
```

- Find tail index
```{r}
lrtest(c(rep(0,93),rep(1,7)),0.05)  
```

- Result of piecewise linear scoring function
```{r}
pwls(0.09,0.05,0.95)
```

More details can be found in the vignettes.
