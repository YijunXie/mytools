This is edited in RStudio and all changes on GitHub are made locally. I got help from this [website](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html#citation_syntax) for how to make citations. I also got help for font color from [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29067541/rmarkdown-how-to-change-the-font-color)
